# Kyuubi Configuration Guide 

Kyuubi provides several kinds of properties to configure the system:

**Kyuubi properties:** control most Kyuubi server's own behaviors. Most of them determined on server starting. They can be treat like normal Spark properties by setting them in `spark-defaults.conf` file or via `--conf` parameter in server starting scripts.

**Spark properties:** become session level options, which are used to generate a SparkContext instances and passed to Kyuubi Server by JDBC/ODBC connection strings. Setting them in `$SPARK_HOME/conf/spark-defaults.conf` supplies with default values for each session.

**Hive properties:** are used for SparkSession to talk to the Hive MetaStore Server could be configured in a `hive-site.xml`  and placed it in `$SPARK_HOME/conf` directory, or treating them as Spark properties with `spark.hadoop.` prefix.

**Hadoop properties:** specifying `HADOOP_CONF_DIR` or `YARN_CONF_DIR` to the directory contains hadoop configuration files.

**Logging** can be configured through `$SPARK_HOME/conf/log4j.properties`.

## Kyuubi Configurations

Kyuubi properties control most Kyuubi server's own behaviors. Most of them determined on server starting. They can be treat like normal Spark properties by setting them in `spark-defaults.conf` file or via `--conf` parameter in server starting scripts.     

For instance, start Kyuubi with HA enabled.
```bash
$ bin/start-kyuubi.sh \ 
    --master yarn \
    --deploy-mode client \
    --driver-memory 10g \
    --conf spark.kyuubi.ha.enabled=true \
    --conf spark.kyuubi.ha.zk.quorum=zk1.server.url,zk2.server.url
```

#### High Availability

Name|Default|Description
---|---|---
spark.kyuubi.ha.enabled|false|Whether KyuubiServer supports dynamic service discovery for its clients. To support this, each instance of KyuubiServer currently uses ZooKeeper to register itself, when it is brought up. JDBC/ODBC clients should use the ZooKeeper ensemble: spark.kyuubi.ha.zk.quorum in their connection string.

#### Background Execution Thread Pool

Name|Default|Description

spark.kyuubi.async.exec.threads|100|Number of threads in the async thread pool for KyuubiServer.

spark.kyuubi.async.exec.keep.alive.time|10,000|Time (in milliseconds) that an idle KyuubiServer async thread (from the thread pool) will wait for a new task to arrive before terminating.
spark.kyuubi.async.exec.shutdown.timeout|10,000|How long KyuubiServer shutdown will wait for async threads to terminate.

#### Kyuubi Session

spark.kyuubi.frontend.session.check.operation| true |Session will be considered to be idle only if there is no activity, and there is no pending operation. This setting takes effect only if session idle timeout `spark.kyuubi.frontend.session.timeout` and checking `spark.kyuubi.frontend.session.check.interval` are enabled.

#### Spark Session

Name|Default|Description
---|---|---
spark.kyuubi.backend.session.wait.other.times | 60 | How many times to check when another session with the same user is initializing SparkContext. Total Time will be times by `spark.kyuubi.backend.session.wait.other.interval`.

## Spark Configurations
All properties of Spark can be set as servel level ones. Some of them only work for Kyuubi server itself and become unchangable, such as `spark.driver.memory` specifying the heap memory of server. Session level Spark properties take Server lever ones as default values and can be changed with session connection strings. And obviously, all sql properties of Spark can be set via `set` statement at runtime, such as `set spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold=-1`

#### Session Level
Spark properties which becomes session level options, which are used to generate a `SparkContext` instances and passed to Kyuubi Server by JDBC/ODBC connection strings. Setting them in `$SPARK_HOME/conf/spark-defaults.conf` supplies with default values for each session.     

#### Server Level
Name|Default|Description
---|---|---
spark.driver.memory| 1g | Amount of memory to use for the Kyuubi Server instance. Set this through the --driver-memory command line option or in your default properties file.
spark.driver.extraJavaOptions| (none) | A string of extra JVM options to pass to the Kyuubi Server instance. For instance, GC settings or other logging. Set this through the --driver-java-options command line option or in your default properties file.

Spark use netty as RPC between driver and executor, Kyuubi Server may need much bigger directory memory size.

```properties
spark.driver.extraJavaOptions -XX:PermSize=1024m -XX:MaxPermSize=1024m  -XX:MaxDirectMemorySize=4096m
```

Spark properties for [Driver](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/configuration.html#runtime-environment) like those above controls Kyuubi Server's own behaviors, while other properies could be set in JDBC/ODBC connection strings.

Please refer to the [Configuration Guide](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/configuration.html) in the online documentation for an overview on how to configure Spark.

## Hive Configurations

#### Hive client options
These configurations are used for SparkSessin to talk to Hive MetaStore Server could be configured in a `hive-site.xml`  and placed it in `$SPARK_HOME/conf` directory, or treating them as Spark properties with `spark.hadoop.` prefix.

## Hadoop Configurations
Please refer to the [Apache Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org)'s online documentation for an overview on how to configure Hadoop.
